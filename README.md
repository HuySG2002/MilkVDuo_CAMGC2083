# Driver Drowsiness Detection using Milk-V Duo 256M and CAM-GC2083 (Linux - C++)

This project implements a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using the Milk-V Duo 256M development board and the CAM-GC2083 camera module. The system captures live facial images, analyzes eye closure and head position patterns, and identifies early signs of drowsiness using computer vision techniques.

The goal is to improve road safety by alerting the driver when signs of fatigue or microsleep are detected.
